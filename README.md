Clann: constructing consensus trees and supertrees from multiple source trees

Overview

Clann: Construction of Supertrees and exploration of phylogenomic information from partially overlapping datasets.

Clann (the Irish word for “family”), is a free software program designed and written by Chris Creevey.

The purpose of the program is to implement methods of determining the optimal phylogenetic supertrees, given a set of input source trees.

Aim

To construct supertrees and explore the underlying phylogenomic information from partially overlapping datasets. The program Clann has been developed to provide implementations of several supertree methods. The methods implemented all allow the investigation of data in a phylogenomic context. It is important that the user understands the advantages and limitations of these methods. It is also important for the user to know that the software is designed to perform a number of different tasks, however the interpretation of the results is left entirely to the user.

Clann has been published in Bioinformatics in 2005 under the following title:

Creevey C.J. and McInerney J.O. 2005 Clann: investigating phylogenetic information through supertree analyses. Bioinformatics 21(3): 390-2.

The Bootstrapping and YAPTP methods and the DFIT (most similar supertree algorithm) have all been described in the paper:

Creevey C.J., Fitzpatrick, D.A., Philip, G.A., Kinsella, R.J., O’Connell M.J., Travers, S.A, Wilkinson M. and McInerney J.O. 2004 Does a tree-like phylogeny only exist at the tips in the prokaryotes? Proceedings of the Royal Society London, B series: Biological Sciences 271(1557): 2551-8.

Either or both of these publications should be cited if you use Clann in published work.
