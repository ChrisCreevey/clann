to install type:
   "./configure"

followed by:
	 "make"

Clann will then be located in this directory

######

	Note: If running "make" returns an error such as:

		CDPATH="${ZSH_VERSION+.}:" && cd . && aclocal-1.16
		/bin/sh: aclocal-1.16: command not found
		make: *** [aclocal.m4] Error 127

	try running:
		"autoreconf -f -i"
	followed by:
		"./configure"
		"make"
	to resolve the issue (Thanks to Michael Broe for suggesting this fix).

#######

the use of "make install" may not work depending on write privileges

=======


# Special Note: if you get this message when doing the "./configure" command:
"-bash: ./configure: Permission denied"
# then do the following command: 
"chmod +x configure"
and then continue on to:
"make"
